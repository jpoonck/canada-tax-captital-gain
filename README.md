# Trading Analysis Project

This project is designed to calculate capital gains, losses, and tax implications for a series of trades with data sorcering from a IBKR CSV file. The project uses pandas for data manipulation and numpy for numerical computations.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Excute the following command:

    ```sh
    py src/main.py
    ```

## Usage

Place your IBKR trading data in the `data/` directory and run the scripts in the `src/` directory to perform analysis and summary.
